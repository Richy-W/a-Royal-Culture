		<p>With origins in the Middle Ages, Wartburg castle houses much history and continues to entice tourists from all over the world. Situated atop a cliff overlooking the town of Eisenach in central Germany, the castle clearly exhibits the distinct architectural and cultural styles of the many centuries of its existence. The foundation was laid in roughly 1067 by Ludwig der Springer, who is rumored to have brought soil from his lands and spread them across the top of the hill (which was situated just outside of his lands) before laying the foundation, so that the fortress would technically be on his lands. The next major reconstruction of the site occurred around 250 years later, after the castle had suffered a fire caused by lightning. More additions and restorations were made to the castle up until 1648, after which the structures were no longer used, and left to decay. It wasn’t until 1838 that the Grand Duke Karl Alexander would commission Hugo von Ritgen to rebuild and renovate the castle, and this process became the main architect’s life work; finishing fifty years later in 1889. This 19th century version of the castle became the influence for the grand Neuschwanstein Castle, commissioned by King Ludwig II, in Bavaria.</p>

		<br>

		<p>Throughout its existence, Wartburg has been a hub for radicalism, scholastics, and the arts. In the early days, popular poets such as Walther von der Vogelweide and Wolfram von Eschenbach used the estate as a place of inspiration for their works. By their influence, it then became the location for the legendary Sängerkrieg, (Minstrels’ Contest)—an event whose existence has been debated by historians for centuries. Probably the most notable resident of the castle was theologian Martin Luther, who after his excommunication from the Catholic Church in 1521 went into hiding within the castle walls. It was here that he translated the Bible’s New Testament from ancient Greek to German. His version quickly spread in popularity across Europe, and is still a basis for many biblical translations today.</p>

		<br>
		<br>

		<p>In modern day, the castle has been transformed into a museum, and is a popular tourist destination. Concerts, operas, and other entertainment events are held regularly, and a 19th century hotel (built at the same time as the castle’s mid-1800’s renovations) is located nearby for guests wishing to spend some extra time at the estate.</p>
